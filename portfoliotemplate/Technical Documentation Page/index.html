            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.
            </li>

            To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git:
          </p>
        </article>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>git init</strong> initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.</li>
        <li><strong>git clone</strong> creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.</li>
        <li><strong>git add .</strong> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.</li>
        <li><strong>git commit</strong> saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with <strong>git add</strong> will become a part of the snapshot with <strong>git commit</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>git status</strong> shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.</li>
        <li><strong>git branch</strong> shows the branches being worked on locally.</li>
        <li><strong>git merge</strong> merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>git pull</strong> updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.</li>
        <li><strong>git push</strong> updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="About_repositories">
        <header>About repositories</header>
        <article>
        A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits. The commits can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who has a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a Git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning the repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.<br> <br>

Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.

        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>

          <code
            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code
          >
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code
          >

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:

          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code

          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.

          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
